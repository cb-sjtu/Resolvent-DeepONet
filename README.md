# Resolvent-DeepONet
Resolvent-DeepONet: A Hybrid Framework for Predicting Energy Fluctuations in Wall-Bounded Turbulence Across Reynolds Numbers

All the codes are developed on basis of DEEPXDE(https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cite_deepxde.html).

Before you run the codes of different models, the net module file in DEEPXDE should be replaced by 'module.py'.
